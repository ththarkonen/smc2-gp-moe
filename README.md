# SMC2 sampled mixtures of Gaussian process experts
Implementation of SMC2 mixtures of Gaussian process experts. This is a repository for the software used to create some of the results for the paper 
"Mixtures of Gaussian Process Experts with SMC2'' ([arxiv.org/abs/2208.12830](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12830)).

The software approximates posterior distributions for parameters of mixtures of Gaussian process experts. For a detailed description of the sampling procedure see the aforementioned paper.

# Installation
Clone or download the repository and add the include folder and subfolders to your MATLAB path. This should happen automatically on running the main script in the project root folder.
